<!--
You can list as many <source> entries in a file as you wish.
Files or urls for sources and channels ending in '.gz' will be treated as
gzipped and decompressed while processing.
Use the "type" attribute to set the python module that handles the file,
currently only type="gen_xmltv" is supported, more will follow once this plugin
gets more popular.
The channels property is the local file or URL with channel ID to service ref
mappings. The default is the same filename but with .channels.xml as extension.
Each source may use a different channels definition, or multiple sources may use
the same, whatever is convenient.
The description must be unique for each source, and is displayed on the UI.
